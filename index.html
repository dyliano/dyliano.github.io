	<h1>Who am I?</h1>
	<p>You sure you want to know? The story of my life is not for the faint of heart. If somebody said it was a happy little tale.. if somebody told you I was just your average, ordinary guy, not a care in the world... somebody lied.</p>
	<h1>What's different from official or AzzyC's build?</h1>
	<p>Cmon now. Both mine and Azzy's builds are far superior to official and I like to think that my build is a tad betterer than Azzy's. One of the notable changes is the fact that GApps is included and some LineageOS apps have been removed.
